In the bustling landscape of FMCG instant noodles, the challenge of balancing supply and demand across numerous warehouses nationwide is paramount. This mismatch not only disrupts operational efficiency but also impacts customer satisfaction and revenue streams. To address this issue, the following project outlines strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing supply chain dynamics and achieving seamless synchronization between supply and demand across all distribution channels.

The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. Also try to analysis the demand pattern in different pockets of the country so management can drive the advertisement campaign particular in those pockets.
